# Mini Facebook Project (in Python)

Hi there! I'm **Codelearner01**, a self-learning Pythonist.

This is a personal project I'm building to grow my skills — a **mini Facebook**-like system with basic features like:
- User signup and login
- Saving user data
- Sending and receiving friend requests
- Managing a simple friend list

### Why I Made This
I'm learning Python step by step and wanted to build something **bigger than a calculator**, but **not too complex** to scare myself. So this is it — my learning space.

### What I Hope For
If you’re reading this and you’re a fellow learner, beginner, or even an experienced developer:
- Feel free to look at the code
- Share tips, corrections, or suggestions
- Or just say hi!

I'm open to feedback and would love to **connect with others who are learning too**.

Thanks for stopping by!
